HOMEWORK: HOMEWORK 6.3

Let's now add a new shard. Run another mongod as the new shard on a new port number. Use --shardsvr.

Then add the shard to the cluster (see sh.help()).

You can confirm the above worked by running:

homework.check1()
Now wait for the balancer to move data among the two shards more evenly. Periodically run:
use config
db.chunks.find( { ns:"week6.trades" }, {min:1,max:1,shard:1,_id:0} ).sort({min:1})
and/or:
db.chunks.aggregate( [
 { $match : { ns : "week6.trades" } } , 
 { $group : { _id : "$shard", n : { $sum : 1 } } }
] )
When done, run homework.c() and enter the result value.
That completes this week's homework. However if you want to explore more, something to try would be to try some queries and/or write operations with a single process down to see how the system behaves in such a situation.
