mongo --shell localhost/performance performance.js
homework.init()
Build an index on the "active" and "tstamp" fields. You can verify that you've done your job with

When you are done, run:

homework.a()
and enter the numeric result below (no spaces).

Answer
db.sensor_readings.createIndex({active:1,tstamp:1})
homework.a()
